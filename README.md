# Student Affairs Website

## Description

The FCI Student Management System is a web application developed as part of a web development course. 
This project was designed to help students practice and apply various concepts and techniques learned during the course. 
The application is intended for managing student information within the Faculty of Computers and Information (FCI).

## Features
User Management:

1. Add new students with details such as ID, name, date of birth, GPA, gender, level, status, department, email, and mobile number.
   
2. Update existing student information (with the department field disabled for editing).
   
3. Delete student data with confirmation prompts to ensure data integrity.

Search and Assignment:

1. Search for active students by name, displaying results in a table format.
   
2. Assign departments to students at level 3, with error handling for invalid actions.
   
Status Management:

1. View all active and inactive students in a table.

2. Change student status between active and inactive directly from the table.

Navigation and Design:

1. A common homepage listing all potential projects (Human Resources, Student Affairs, Higher Studies, Laboratory Tracking).

2. Well-designed navigation bar for seamless access to all functionalities.

3. Frontend validations and dynamic content handling using JavaScript.

4. CSS for styling to create a user-friendly interface.
